    MySQL Enterprise Monitor is an enterprise monitoring system for MySQL that keeps an
    eye on your MySQL servers, notifies you of potential issues and
    problems, and advises you how to fix the issues. MySQL Enterprise Monitor can
    monitor all kinds of configurations, from a single MySQL server that
    is important to your business, all the way up to a huge farm of
    MySQL servers powering a busy web site.
  </p><p>
    The following discussion briefly describes the basic components that
    make up the MySQL Enterprise Monitor product. For more information, see the MySQL Enterprise Monitor
    manual, available at
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-monitor/en/" target="_top">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-monitor/en/</a>.
  </p><p>
    MySQL Enterprise Monitor components can be installed in various configurations
    depending on your own database and network topology, to give you the
    best combination of reliable and responsive monitoring data, with
    minimal overhead on the database server machines. A typical MySQL Enterprise Monitor
    installation consists of:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        One or more MySQL servers that you want to monitor. MySQL Enterprise Monitor can
        monitor both Community and Enterprise MySQL server releases.
      </p></li><li><p>
        A MySQL Enterprise Agent for each monitored MySQL server.
      </p></li><li><p>
        A single MySQL Enterprise Service Manager, which collates information from the
        agents, and provides the user interface to the collected data.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    MySQL Enterprise Monitor is designed to monitor one or more MySQL servers. The
    monitoring information is collected by using an agent,
    <em class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Agent</em>. The agent communicates with
    the MySQL server that it monitors, collecting variables, status and
    health information, and sending this information to the
    MySQL Enterprise Service Manager. If you have multiple MySQL servers, then you have
    multiple MySQL Enterprise Agent processes monitoring each MySQL server.
  </p><p>
    The information collected by the agent about each MySQL server you
    are monitoring is sent to the
    <em class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Service Manager</em>. This server collates all of
    the information from the agents. As it collates the information sent
    by the agents, the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager continually tests the collected
    data, comparing the status of the server to reasonable values. When
    thresholds are reached, the server can trigger an event (including
    an alarm and notification) to highlight a potential issue, such as
    low memory, high CPU usage, or more complex conditions such
    insufficient buffer sizes and status information. We call each test,
    with its associated threshold value, a <em class="firstterm">rule</em>.
  </p><p>
    These rules, and the alarms and notifications, are each known as a
    <em class="firstterm">MySQL Enterprise Advisor</em>. Advisors form a critical
    part of the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager, as they provide warning information and
    troubleshooting advice about potential problems.
  </p><p>
    The MySQL Enterprise Service Manager includes a web server, and you interact with it
    through any web browser. This interface, the MySQL Enterprise Dashboard,
    displays all of the information collected by the agents, and lets
    you view all of your servers and their current status as a group or
    individually. You control and configure all aspects of the service
    using the MySQL Enterprise Dashboard.
  </p><p>
    The information supplied by the MySQL Enterprise Agent processes also
    includes statistical and query information, which you can view in
    the form of graphs. For example, you can view aspects such as server
    load, query numbers, or index usage information as a graph over
    time. The graph lets you pinpoint problems or potential issues on
    your server, and can help diagnose the impact from database or
    external problems (such as external system or network failure) by
    examining the data from a specific time interval.
  </p><p>
    The MySQL Enterprise Agent can also be configured to collect detailed
    information about the queries executed on your server, including the
    row counts and performance times for executing each query. You can
    correlate the detailed query data with the graphical information to
    identify which queries were executing when you experienced a
    particularly high load, index or other issue. The query data is
    supported by a system called Query Analyzer, and the data can be
    presented in different ways depending on your needs.
