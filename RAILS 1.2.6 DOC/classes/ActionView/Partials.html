There&#8217;s also a convenience method for rendering sub templates within
the current controller that depends on a single object (we call this kind
of sub templates for partials). It relies on the fact that partials should
follow the naming convention of being prefixed with an underscore &#8212;
as to separate them from regular templates that could be rendered on their
own.
</p>
<p>
In a template for Advertiser#account:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;account&quot; %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This would render &quot;advertiser/_account.rhtml&quot; and pass the
instance variable @account in as a local variable <tt>account</tt> to the
template for display.
</p>
<p>
In another template for Advertiser#buy, we could have:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;account&quot;, :locals =&gt; { :account =&gt; @buyer } %&gt;

  &lt;% for ad in @advertisements %&gt;
    &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;ad&quot;, :locals =&gt; { :ad =&gt; ad } %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This would first render &quot;advertiser/_account.rhtml&quot; with @buyer
passed in as the local variable <tt>account</tt>, then render
&quot;advertiser/_ad.rhtml&quot; and pass the local variable <tt>ad</tt> to
the template for display.
</p>
<h2>Rendering a collection of partials</h2>
<p>
The example of partial use describes a familiar pattern where a template
needs to iterate over an array and render a sub template for each of the
elements. This pattern has been implemented as a single method that accepts
an array and renders a partial by the same name as the elements contained
within. So the three-lined example in &quot;Using partials&quot; can be
rewritten with a single line:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;ad&quot;, :collection =&gt; @advertisements %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This will render &quot;advertiser/_ad.rhtml&quot; and pass the local
variable <tt>ad</tt> to the template for display. An iteration counter will
automatically be made available to the template with a name of the form
<tt>partial_name_counter</tt>. In the case of the example above, the
template would be fed <tt>ad_counter</tt>.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Due to backwards compatibility concerns, the collection can&#8217;t
be one of hashes. Normally you&#8217;d also just keep domain objects, like
Active Records, in there.
</p>
<h2>Rendering shared partials</h2>
<p>
Two controllers can share a set of partials and render them like this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;advertisement/ad&quot;, :locals =&gt; { :ad =&gt; @advertisement } %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This will render the partial &quot;advertisement/_ad.rhtml&quot; regardless
of which controller this is being called from.
